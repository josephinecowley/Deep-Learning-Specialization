# Deep Learning Specialization

This repository serves as a backup for my completed notebooks from Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization. Please note that some notebooks are not fully completed, and the actual notebooks may not run since I haven't uploaded all of the training data and helper functions, which are too large to upload to GitHub.

## Course Structure

The Deep Learning Specialization consists of five courses:

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
   - **Week 1:** Introduction to deep learning and neural networks
   - **Week 2:** Binary classification and logistic regression
   - **Week 3:** Shallow neural networks
   - **Week 4:** Deep neural networks

2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization**
   - **Week 1:** Practical aspects of deep learning
   - **Week 2:** Optimization algorithms
   - **Week 3:** Hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and programming frameworks

3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**
   - **Week 1:** Setting up machine learning projects
   - **Week 2:** Machine learning strategy

4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
   - **Week 1:** Foundations of convolutional neural networks
   - **Week 2:** Deep convolutional models: case studies
   - **Week 3:** Object detection
   - **Week 4:** Special applications: face recognition and neural style transfer

5. **Sequence Models**
   - **Week 1:** Recurrent neural networks
   - **Week 2:** Natural language processing and word embeddings
   - **Week 3:** Sequence models and attention mechanism

## Notes

- Due to the absence of large training datasets and helper functions, some notebooks may not execute as intended.
- This repository is intended for backup and reference purposes.
- Week 3 material is not present, since this did not require python notebooks, but rather quizzes on ML strategyy.
